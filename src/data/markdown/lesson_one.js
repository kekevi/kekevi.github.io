const lesson_one = `# Lesson 1: Deploy Your Own React Site + Learn Git

Hello here is my site based on this markdown format. This seems pretty complicated
with the mixing of so many technologies here: HTML, CSS, JS, React-JSX, Md. There's like four index.html's 
and I am kinda confused on what to do with each of them.

But so far it seems like this the education team is more organized than last semester's.

## about me

Hello, my name is Kevin Chen and I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and am still deciding if I would rather do Statistics or
Linguistics as my second major/minor. I'm from Charlotte, NC and am excited to learn about how to use React!
# What's next?

In the following week, make the website you're own! Change the css + add information about you and come to optional office hours to learn more about the app's setup.

Your tasks:

- Edit at least 2 files and upload those changes to github (tell us about you!)
- Find 2 personal sites with super cool designs (in your opinion) from software engineers / designers / people in the tech world. We'll be using this as inspo to learn about CSS in the future!
